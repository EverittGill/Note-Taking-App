# <Note-Taking-App>

## Description

This is a very simple full stack application that allows a user to write and save notes for future reference

- I was motivated to do this because my favorite note taking app Color Note is not available on my new phone.
- I was frustrated that I lost access to all my old notes and I decided to make my own application to take notes
- It solves the problem of me not having a reliable way to take notes 
- I learned that modularization is very complicated and extremely simple at the same time.
- I learned the basics of using Heroku
